# bootstrap

> Setup for a local environment just the way I like it


## purpose

This package contains the stateless environment that I use, specifically:

  * SSH identity
  * Utility scripts
  * Repositories I use frequently
  * Debian packages
  * Scripts to setup the environment, including checking out this repository.

## Initialisation

This repository initialises itself.
Obviously, dont do this if you think I'll gain control of your system.
Run the command:

    git clone https://github.com/scyptnex/bootstrap.git bootstrap && bootstrap/init/init.sh
